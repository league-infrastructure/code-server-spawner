# Security, API Acess and Tokens. 


## Digital Ocean API

The API token for the Digital Ocean API is generated for the user
`leaguebot@jointheleague.org`, which has the role of Agent. This role
has a limited number of permissions it can have, so when you create a 
new API token for the League Bot, you just select all 
of the permissions available.
