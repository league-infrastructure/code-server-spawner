    <h1>The Phantom Server</h1>
    <p>In the gloom of his solitary apartment, lit only by the dim glow of an
    aging monitor, Elias Marlowe pondered the cryptic email he had received. A
    single command: <code>telnet 192.168.13.13 6666</code>. No sender, no
    subject. A jest? A lure? Or something far darker?</p>
    
    <p>His fingers, trembling with a nameless trepidation, entered the command.
    The terminal flickered, then dissolved into a void of silence. A connection
    was established, and from the depths of that digital abyss, a message
    materialized:</p>
    
    <p><em>"Welcome, Elias. We have been expecting you."</em></p>
    
    <p>His breath caught. The server knew his name. Impossible! And yet, before
    he could react, the cursor moved—unbidden—scrolling through commands he had
    never typed.</p>
    
    <p>“WHO ARE YOU?” he attempted to reply, his keystrokes sluggish as though
    wading through thick, unseen molasses.</p>
    
    <p>The response was instant.</p>
    
    <p><em>"We are the ghosts in the machine, Elias. We know what you
    seek."</em></p>
    
    <p>He felt the room grow colder, his breath now visible in the pale light. A
    file named <code>TRUTH.txt</code> appeared in his directory. Hesitant, yet
    unable to resist, he opened it.</p>
    
    <p>It contained but a single sentence.</p>
    
    <p><em>“You should not have logged in.”</em></p>
    <p>At that moment, the lights flickered. The screen went black. And
    
    somewhere, in the unseen recesses of cyberspace, something laughed.</p>
